title: I 'AM' Radio
---

In my last two posts, I talked about telegraph and telephone. Both these modes were wired. The entire country of USA had wires running across it so as to connect all states through this medium. Shortly after this followed the laying down of the transatlantic cable. In the late nineteenth century, as both these modes of communication were gaining popularity, there was an increasing need for a 'wireless' mode of communication.

Maxwell had already shaken the scientific community as he proved the existence of 'electromagnetic waves' - changing electric field induced a changing magnetic field and vice versa. Most, however, did not immediately realize how those four differential equations were going to shape the world and form the basis of the communication technology we know today.

Hertz became the first ever to claim transmission of these electromagnetic waves, thus proving Maxwell's theory. His experimental set-up can be seen in the figure below. When a high voltage was applied across the metal plates, a spark could be seen between the metal spheres. This spark essentially consisted of electrons that were dancing around (more specifically, oscillating at the resonant frequency of the L-C circuit). According to the theory, these electrons must transmit electromagnetic waves. This was found to be true as a spark could be seen across the metal spheres of the metal ring which was electrically isolated from the transmitting circuit.

Electromagnetic waves really did exist. It was then that Marconi, who we know today as the father of radio, conceptualized and successfully implemented wireless telegraphy. He transmitted Morse code over radio waves. How did he do so? Marconi used a spark-gap transmitter and crystal radio receivers. A relatively fun explanation of the spark gap transmitter can be found [here](http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/spark.html). As for the 'crystal radio', it was called so because it used a semiconductor crystal to demodulate the received RF signal. For the purposes of transmission of Morse code, it was done so by turning the Rf on and off. The RF still could not carry audio signals.

The first AM voice transmission was made by Canadian researcher Reginald Fessenden on 23 December 1900. If you know a little bit about spark gap generators - they produced damped waves. Fessenden realized that in order to transmit audio, one need 'CW' - or continuous waves that could then be 'modulated'. He developed his own transmitter, better known as the Alexanderson alternator. He also developed the concept of AM waves - Amplitude Modulated Waves. Radio as we know it today was born.
