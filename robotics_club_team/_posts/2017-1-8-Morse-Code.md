Its funny how we do not realize how much easier life has become due to technology. We are today in the age of 4G, theorizing 5G. It all came down from when wired and subsequently radio communication first kicked off. It has only been a little more than a century since Marconi came up with his radio in 1901 and here we are!

My father is an amateur HAM radio enthusiast. I have grown up hearing all the jargon assosciated with radio communication. I thought its time that I really learn about them. I plan to come up with a series of posts about 'Communication'. This is the kick starter - Morse Code!

Morse Code made up for the earliest radio communication - even before it was possible to transmit voice. It is a series of dot(or dits) and dashes(or dahs) which when decoded, make perfect sense. The length of the code assosciated with each letter is inversely proportional to its frequency of use in the English Language. This was an effort to increase the speed with which Morse Code in transmitted - often measured in terms of wpm(words per minute).

Morse Code was first used by its inventor-Morse over an electrical telegraph. It gradually evolved to being transmitted over radio waves. This was the first time ever that aviation and marine communication became a reality. We all know that Mayday was preceded by ...- - -... . 

I would not talk about how morse code is transmitted over radio waves - that is for another post on Radio itself. Here I want to talk about the electrical telegraph. Wikipedia defines telegraphy as the long distance transmission of textual or symbolic messages without the physical exchange of an object bearing the message. Easy enough. Not much science goes behind working of a telegraph. The working of an electric telegraph is essentially synonymous with switching on and off of an electric circuit. The switch is fondly called the 'morse key'. The circuit is as shown below

On pressing the switch, the circuit completes and current flows. This is turn makes the electromagnet jump into action and it pulls the armature towards itself. The pen, which is attached to the armature now leaves an impression on the moving paper strip. The transmission is now complete! Here is what a 'strip of transmitted message' looks like. This is actually the first ever telegraphic message which reads: "What hath God wrought?" - sent by Morse himself.

Today as morse code is slowly bidding us farewell, we still get it to hear about it sometimes. I bet the 90s kids know the famous ...- -... which is more synonymous with the Nokia SMS tune than Morse code itself. Still, some radio enthusiasts are keeping it alive. Maybe, next you want to get creative with your letters or cards - use Morse Code!
