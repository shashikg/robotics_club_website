Recently, I bought the [Redmi Band 2](http://www.mi.com/in/miband2/). There was not any particular intention behind it, just that I wanted to try one of those fitness bands/smart watches and the latter was pretty expensive :-P.

So, this post is going to be a little diversion from the 'communication series'.
(I will be adding tags to the posts, so as to differentiate them. Please bear with me till then. Also, you would be able to 'follow' this blog in near future!)

The band has some awesome sensors packed into it. And seems that they are power efficient too(I charge once in almost 3 weeks). One of the sensors is the heart rate sensor - I did not know anything about how they work, so I decided to look it up!

Turns out that the heart rate sensor is pretty cool stuff - there is major science(or biology?) behind it. Have you ever turned on a torch and pressed it into your palm? If you have, did you see the red glow? You might have guessed it right - that's your blood happily flowing about! The heart rate sensors, or more specifically the optical heart rate sensor, uses photoplethysmography(PPG). 
PPG essentially means that when the heart pumps and consequentially the volume of blood through any organ increases momentarily, it causes a change in the amount of light reflected/absorbed. Heart rate sensors consist of a LED(mostly green) and a photosensor. The LED is continuously on and shining on your skin. When heart pumps, the volume of blood increases and hence does the absorption of light. So there is a change in the otherwise DC signal received by the photosensor. The frequency of this change is exactly what your heart rate is.

From the signal received by the photosensor, the DC component(the LED was continuously on) is filtered out and so is the high-frequency noise. The low-frequency signal is then amplified and its frequency determined.
But, it does not end here. These sensors face a lot of issues. Their working depends on your skin tone(also whether you are wearing a tattoo or not), where you have placed it on your body(which tissue is reflecting the light), other noises due to movement of the sensor etc. There are filtering algorithms in place for these. As for my Mi Band, it has some pretty good algorithms in place. It succeeds in giving accurate readings most times.

There are other features in my band - pedometer, Bluetooth connectivity, setting up alarms, idle alert etc. I hope I will be able to look up most of these, if not all, soon and come back with another post!
