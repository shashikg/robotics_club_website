title: Good Old Telephone
---

Long Distance communication had been made possible by telegraph. But, it was still Morse Code. It was a tedious task to learn the code and one would have to go the telegraph office to send/receive one. Admist all this, telephone was discovered. 

As I stated in the previous post, the telegraph transmitted 'signal' when its switch was closed. The only control over this was 'when to turn it off and on'. Hence only something on the lines of Morse code could be transmitted. Alexander Graham Bell must have realized the power of electrical microphones and speaker(Although it is debatable whether Bell was actually the first one to do it). One could convert voice into an electrical signal and send it over the same wire. One could also receive the same signal and convert it into audio. Kaboom! Telephone was born. Imagine Watson's reaction when he heard Bell's voice coming out of nowhere - when he heard the first ever telephonic message -  "Watson, come here! I want to see you!".	

The two most essential devices that make up the telephone - microphone and speaker work on the same principle. When you speak into a microphone, a 'diaphgram' vibrates. Along with this vibrates a coil of conducting wire. The coil is placed in the field of a permanent magnet. Its movement causes the magnetic flux through it to change and and electric current begins to flow thorugh it. Voice has now been successfully turned into electric signal.  Speakers work on the same principle. It is just that they work in reverse.

This was pretty much an elementary model of the working of a telephone. But I still had some questions.

**How do telephones work without electricity?**
If you have had a 'landline' at home and have had the 'opportunity' of experiencing a power cut, I hope you had noticed that your telephone still works without electricity. This is because, your 'connection' to the exchange is also supplying you power - 48V DC. This goes back to a time when all domestic establishments did not have power connections, hence the telephone exchange took it upon itself to supply enough power to make the telephone 'ring'.

**What is it with starting all telephonic conversations with 'Hello'?**
The credit goes to Thomas Edison who popularized the idea. The first ever telephone directory also suggested its users to do so. Bell thought the better word was 'Ahoy'.

**What is it with dialpad tones?**
These are called DTMF - Dual Tone Multiple Frequencies tones. Tone dialling is actually a way to communicate the number you want to connect to, to the telephone exchange. All numbers 0-9, * and #, each have two frequencies assigned to them. When you 'dial' a number, the corresponding frequencies are generated and sent over the wire. You should be able to dial a number if you are able to reproduce the exact same frequencies.

That's all for this post!
